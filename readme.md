## Introduction

I’m a web developer & designer who crafts intuitive, user-centered experiences by strategically selecting the most appropriate tools for each
project. Self-taught and relentlessly curious, I continuously expand my expertise through hands-on learning. My analytical approach ensures I
meticulously evaluate solutions, weighing trade-offs, scalability and user impact—before implementation, delivering robust outcomes that solve real
problems.
